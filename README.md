# bookmarky

Mozilla Pocket is shutting down. This is basically a place for me to store the bookmarks I had, along with a UI frontend and a script to parse the Pocket export file into a JSON structure. This represents about 15 minutes of work.

In the future it would be nice to have a way to add bookmarks, which would imply self-hosting on a server or an account system. Right now this is static so that it can be hosted on GitHub Pages. Feel free to fork it and use it for your own Pocket export. (Also I think my bookmark collection is pretty interesting to read.)
